# Pseudocode language specifications for use in this compiler and virtual machine

Most of the language remains intact as to the documentation published by Cambridge International Assesment. However, some language features had to be slightly modified as to allow for the parsing of the language, as the pseudocode is very unstructured in places.\
It also serves the purpose of specifying which features are actually included in the grammar subset handled, and which are not (OOP).
