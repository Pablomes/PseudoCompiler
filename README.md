# PseudoCompiler
 
A small compiler and virtual machine for a subset of the Cambridge International Computer Science Pseudocode language written in C. Contains all basic functionalities.

All source files are included in the repo, including a bin folder containing three Windows executables.

Ideally to use, download the executables and set their location as a PATH system variable for use anywhere on the machine.

Language specs will be included shortly in a .md file in this same repo, as some liberties had to be taken to make some language features possible for coherent parsing.
